# Node-RED Severe Weather Alert Map
Build a Severe Weather Alert Map Node-RED Dashboard using The Weather Company APIs

Use [The Weather Company APIs](https://www.ibm.com/products/weather-company-data-packages) to plot all of the current [Severe Weather Alerts](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/XZWZ9K1V) issued by the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/alerts) on a [Node-RED](https://nodered.org) Dashboard

This example flow and Node-RED Dashboard might be useful as part of a [Call for Code](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/) solution. The Call for Code 2021 theme is to help reverse the impact of Climate Change.

Create additional Node-RED flows using the [node-red-contrib-twc-weather](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-twc-weather) package.

### Prerequistes

- [Install Node-RED](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/) on your system or in the cloud
- This flow requires Node-RED v1.1 or higher
- [Add the following nodes](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/runtime/adding-nodes) to your Node-RED palette
  - [node-red-dashboard](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard)
  - [node-red-node-ui-table](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-node-ui-table)
  - [node-red-contrib-web-worldmap](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-web-worldmap)
- If you are participating in the [2021 Call for Code](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/) you can [register](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/tools/weather/) for a time limited TWC API key.
- Learn more about the TWC APIs used in this Node-RED flow by reading the [TWC Severe Weather API documentation](https://ibm.co/v3WAHa)
